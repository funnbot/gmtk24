## Ideas
- you design snowflakes
- mouse racing, you are a mouse, or you are on a mouse, or you are racing mice.
- platformer where you are a dust bunny running from a vacuum.
- you are a tardigrade and you have to survive in different environments
- you are a virus and you have to infect a host
- you are a seed and you have to grow into a tree
- you are a water droplet and you have to navigate through a river
- you are a pollen grain and you have to pollinate flowers
- you are fitting together puzzle pieces and the pieces are farmland plots, or buildings, or something, viewed from above, and you are trying to reconstruct the original picture.
- you play as an ant that finds a liquid ant trap, and you as the player know the entire time that it is poison, but you are forced somehow to go back to your colony and lead them to the poison, and then you watch as your entire colony dies.
- you can switch perspectives/players, where one is super tiny, and one is super big
	- the big character could position themselves to be a platform for the little character,
	- the little character could go into tiny places to flip switches or get items.
	- similar to the It Takes Two space level with the ability to change size.
- you play as a ant or tiny bug, but from the perspective of like an adult looking down, so your character is super tiny on the screen.
- you set the scope way to big so just little parts of the game are finished and its obvious that the scope was too big
- a visual novel with each character being a planet in the solar system.
- a crow that drops rocks into a bowl to make water rise to get a snack
- crow puzzles.
- a game where the level is a fractal that you can zoom into.
- cells at work
- bacteria fighting rpg play as white blood cell.
- the butterfly effect
	- the viewed speed of time is really fast
		- or time travel/time loops but fast time is cooler
	- and you are small/make a small change
	- and then you can see a large effect from that change
- destroying a city as godzilla
- a tiny character on a leaf going down river rapids and you need to go back and forth or you need to balance it or you need to scoop out the water.
- play as a tiny insect and you make the treck to find something important/ your home, and it takes like, 24 real time hours for the player to actually walk that distance.
- Kinda like Evangelion, you protect a city in a giant mech
- The mice that sew Cinderellas dress?
- Something pickmin-like, Collectathon maybe
- Creature building as a God 
- Making molecules
- Being a leviathin class apex predator
