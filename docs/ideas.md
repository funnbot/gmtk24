### Concepts
- size, scale, dimensions
- spore cell stage
- planets
- changing scale
- side scrolling platformer
- able to change your size in the game to solve puzzles
- change the size of objects in game to solve puzzles
- change the size of the world to solve puzzles
- the time scale
- comparing the scale of time for different things
	- life of a fly vs a human
- scale models
- show the extremes of scale
- a thing or concept that exists at a scale we are not accustomed to.
- macro photography
- something that is really small but has a lot of power/impact/influence (ants, viruses, malaria)

### Small Things
- ants
- bacteria
- cells
- atoms
- virus
- dust
- pollen
- water droplets
- snowflakes
- seeds
- small toys
- a mini figure in a lego world
- tardigrades

### Big Things
- planets
- stars
- galaxies
- big trees
- mountains
- concept of gods
- giants/titans

#### Big Animals
- whales
- elephants
- dinosaurs

### Things That Change Size
- plants
- puffer fish
- balloons
- water shaping a lake or river
- ice melting
- snowballs rolling down a hill
- trees
- anything that ages

### Things that are comparatively vastly different in size
- the perspective of a child vs an adult
- a toy version of an object
- a model of a building that can control or effect the real building

### Experiences that give a sense of scale
- seeing the earth from the moon
- birds eye view perspective
	- the patterns of farmland
	- coastlines
	- city grids
- the feeling of being in a large crowd
- a pattern forming when viewed from a distance
- the bigger picture
- patterns revealed when viewed up close
- fractals
- infinite scale

## Ideas
- you design snowflakes
- mouse racing, you are a mouse, or you are on a mouse, or you are racing mice.
- platformer where you are a dust bunny running from a vacuum.
- you are a tardigrade and you have to survive in different environments
- you are a virus and you have to infect a host
- you are a seed and you have to grow into a tree
- you are a water droplet and you have to navigate through a river
- you are a pollen grain and you have to pollinate flowers
- you are fitting together puzzle pieces and the pieces are farmland plots, or buildings, or something, viewed from above, and you are trying to reconstruct the original picture.
- you play as an ant that finds a liquid ant trap, and you as the player know the entire time that it is poison, but you are forced somehow to go back to your colony and lead them to the poison, and then you watch as your entire colony dies.
- you can switch perspectives/players, where one is super tiny, and one is super big
	- the big character could position themselves to be a platform for the little character,
	- the little character could go into tiny places to flip switches or get items.
	- similar to the It Takes Two space level with the ability to change size.
- you play as a ant or tiny bug, but from the perspective of like an adult looking down, so your character is super tiny on the screen.
- you set the scope way to big so just little parts of the game are finished and its obvious that the scope was too big
- a visual novel with each character being a planet in the solar system.
- a crow that drops rocks into a bowl to make water rise to get a snack
- crow puzzles.
- a game where the level is a fractal that you can zoom into.
- cells at work
- bacteria fighting rpg play as white blood cell.
- the butterfly effect
	- the viewed speed of time is really fast
		- or time travel/time loops but fast time is cooler
	- and you are small/make a small change
	- and then you can see a large effect from that change
- destroying a city as godzilla
- a tiny character on a leaf going down river rapids and you need to go back and forth or you need to balance it or you need to scoop out the water.
- play as a tiny insect and you make the treck to find something important/ your home, and it takes like, 24 real time hours for the player to actually walk that distance.
- Kinda like Evangelion, you protect a city in a giant mech
- The mice that sew Cinderellas dress?
- Something pickmin-like, Collectathon maybe
- Creature building as a God 
- Making molecules
- Being a leviathin class apex predator
- make yourself and you play as yourself in a little room. And then it switches somehow to a giant character the size of a building, and you step on your house, which kills yourself.
- permanent spore cell stage.
- somehow show the player that they are worthless in comparison to the concept of a god.
- platformer where you progress is constantly impeded by a god that is trying to pick you up and place you back
	- or a bug trying to get food or to escape, and a child thats cupping their hand in front of it.
- space pinball with gravity slingshots using stars, black holes as traps, worm holes to teleport around, asteroids flying across that if they hit you you dont bump off, but you have the energy of the asteroid applied to your velocity, and your planet loses some bits, mass changes. Your health could be the mass of your planet. These ideas could apply to other movement mechanics, not just pinball. black hole below the pin smackers that will always pull the planet down eventually.
- you control a hundreds-thousands of tiny things/creatures, to complete a task. (futile???!!!!?!?!)
- you are a tiny gardener gnome, and you water flowers which grow up, to solve puzzles.
- play as a fish in a school of fish, trying to direct the fish, maybe you are trying to save them from a dangerous thing, but you are a small fish and its hard.
- you are a mosquito and you are trying to avoid a pair of hands that are attempting to clap and kill you.

## Top Ideas

### You are a seed and you have to grow into a tree
**or as a ant colony builder**
**or a microbe colony builder**
- cross section view of tree
- you build the roots towards nutrient patches
- scroll up and down the tree
- rays of sunlight appear and you grow branches and place leaves to collect them.
- competing with other trees to get the sunlight.
- catastrophic events that you need to deal with
	- fungus attacks the tree roots
	- bugs attack the tree leaves
	- disease attacks the tree bark
- symbiotic relationships with other organisms, could be an "upgrade", or a random event.

### A creature builder
- maybe have a unintuitive control method for tweezers or hands.
- get these body parts and stick them together and build a creature
- a larger body piece
- smaller body pieces
- eyes
- a piece that will wiggle back and forth when its placed
- maybe once the creature is done it will be animated with the joints

### Infinite Bug Torture
- blocking the bug from getting food

### Space Pinball or Brick Breaker
- space pinball with gravity slingshots using stars, black holes as traps, worm holes to teleport around, asteroids flying across that if they hit you you don't bump off, but you have the energy of the asteroid applied to your velocity, and your planet loses some bits, mass changes. Your health could be the mass of your planet. These ideas could apply to other movement mechanics, not just pinball. black hole below the pin smackers that will always pull the planet down eventually.

### Controlling Group of Ants
- or a fish trying to direct a school of fish
